<h1>lana del rey</h1>



<p>Club queen on the downtown scene
    Prowling around at night
    You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
    Born to be wild
    
    A little party never hurt no one
    That's why it's alright
    You want in, but you just can't win
    So you hang in the lights
    
    You're so art deco out on the floor
    Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
    Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
    When they all say hello, you try to ignore them
    'Cause you want more (why?)
    You want more (why?)
    You want more (why?)
    'Cause you want more</p>
